Currently, I am a postdoctoral associate at the Jackson Laboratory working in Dr. Gregory Carter’s laboratory. I am wet and dry systems biologist that investigates systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) using multiple -omics, multiple tissues, and potential therapeutics to tease out the molecular underpinnings that contribute to SLE progression.\nAs a proponent of open science I develop novel ways of disseminating research that are:\n\n- transparent\n- reproducible\n- bridge the gap between non-computational and computational biologists\n- make every aspect of research FAIR\n- create a homepage for each research project to find code, data, results, etc.\n\nOutside of research I want to empower non-computational biologists to obtain the computational skills necessary to perform preliminary analyses on their own data. I do this through teaching as a software carpentry instructor.\nWhen I’m not thinking about science I am often riding my bike on the beautiful park loop in Acadia National Park, going for hikes, working out, or generally enjoying the amazing island I live on."
