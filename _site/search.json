I believe that data science can be a powerful tool for addressing complex public policy challenges, and I‚Äôm excited to continue exploring this field. My interest is use data science as a tool to inform decision-making and maximize the impact of a policy in real and complex environments. contexts\nüè¢ Work: I‚Äôm involve in multiple research projects within the Project for Analysis and Decision in Uncertain Contexts. For example, I‚Äôve been estimating the force of infection of the bacteria Helicobacter Pylori (which causes gastric cancer) on the US population using catalytic models. Also, I‚Äôve started to implement Discrete Event Simulation in the natural history of colorrectal cancer as well as other activities related to cancer research for different CISNET groups.\nüèõ Teaching and Education: I‚Äôm passionate about teaching. I‚Äôve worked as a teaching assistant for courses on quantitative methods and public policy evaluation. I‚Äôm also the founder of the Hertie Coding Club, a space where students can learn programming skills for data analysis, wrangling and public policy.\nüé´ Memberships: I‚Äôm part of the Gastric Cancer Group from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET); Trainee member of the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM) and a member of Stanford‚Äôs Data Science x Decision Science DS^2 group."

Seminar Room 2.34\nüóì 13:00 hrs, February 24, 2023\n\nObjective: The main learning outcome is for you to know how to set up reproducible and shareable environments for Python projects, understand how to effectively switch between environments when using an IDE and how to work more efficiently with IDEs, including how to use jupyter code cells within a .py script (a personal favourite of mine). The workshop will focus on Pipenv (the environment and packaging tool officially recommended by the Python developer community) and VSCode (a very customizable and efficient IDE). Nevertheless, the ideas and workflows covered here also apply for other tools (like Anaconda or venv, Sypder or Pycharm)."
