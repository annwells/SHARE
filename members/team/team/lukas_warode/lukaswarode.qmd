I'm part of the first MDS (2023) cohort, interested in data-driven approaches within the realm of social science and politics. Having a background in political science, I'm located somewhere in the intersection of political research and data science. With the experience of my past research positions, I'm currently working as a data research working student at POLITICO, where I assist the development of an analytical infrastructure.
