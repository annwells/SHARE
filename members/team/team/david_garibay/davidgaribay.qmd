I am David, a Data Analyst and a Senior Associate at PADeCI (Spanish acronym for Project of Decision Analysis under Uncertain Contexts). Here, I develop decision-analytic models in health policy, particularly in colorectal and bladder cancer. I am also part of the Bladder cancer modeling group of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET), a member of the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM), and a member of Stanford’s Data Science x Decision Science (DS^2) group. I have a bachelor’s degree in economics and a master’s in methods for public policy analysis. I support evidence-based policymaking, and I consider that data science is a required foundation to generate rigorous and reproducible research.
