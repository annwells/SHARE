Â 

I have been working as a project manager in the field of data science for public policy research since 2019. Having helped set up a Data Science Lab at the Bertelsmann Stiftung, I am particularly interested in how to systematically develop an organisation's infrastructure, governance and culture in the field of data science. Going forward I want to further focus on working at the intersection between management and technical teams.
